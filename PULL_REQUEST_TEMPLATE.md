    * Please use `vX.Y.Z-yymmdd` format e.g. `v2.6.0-231120`
      * `yymmdd` means the date of QA in stage environment, every Monday
    * Limitation: `x.y.z` for npm because it is strict. It is necessary to add date as a meta data in package.json
  * Switch: use #product-switch-scheduling channel
